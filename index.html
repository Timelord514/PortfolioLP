<h1>Bryan Tapfer's Portfolio</h1>


<h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is Bryan Tapfer, and the time has come to make a change in my life. I am a 39 year old person,
    who is married to a lovely woman, named Olivia. We have two wonderful daughters, Marley and Charlotte. 
    We live in Southeast Portland, with our cat April, but are planning on moving next summer to Southwest Portland.
    I have been in the same job for the past <strong>20 years</strong>, but I have been stagnant for too long, and now
    am ready to move on to a new field of work that is more challenging, and rewarding. I have always had an affinity 
    for all things tech, so it made sense to get off my heels, and to jump into a new adventure in my work life.
